# Memory and Attention

#### Working memory

- Central executive (orchestrating slave system)
- Visual-spatial skatchpad (visualization) (Short-term memory)
- Articulatory loop (auditory) (Shot-term memory, when we hear something) It is called a loop because if you were to remember a phone number you would repeat the number again and again in order to remember it.
- Miller (1956): You can freely recall 5-9 items in our working memory. E.i. 5-9 digits, and if we divide digits into chuncks we can remember 5-9 chuncks.

- Cowan (2002): 3-5. (Miller and Cowans numbers has been used to determine how many items that should be displayed at a page at a given time.)
- Chuncking can also be used in design where you group items together. For instance all instances is under the settings part or in Word where there is vertical lines creating categories for the icons.
- Show the user what he needs instead of making him remember where the option he wants is. 
- Persistence: when you close a program and it asks the user if he wants to save. (ensuring that you cannot forget and move on, you have to choose.)



#### Attention

- What we focus upon.
- Concentration of mental effort on sensory or mental events.

#### The Stroop Effect (Attention span)

Read a text with color words and where the word is colored with a different color. It requires much more mental effort to do that.

#### Forms of attention

- Selective attention (Directed towards on element, writing report or working on something else)
- Divided attention (Someone walks in the door and you have to focus on what they say. Or while driving and you focus on your mobile while driving)

The environment often decides which one is used. We have to consider this when designing tings. Like if design an GPS for a car. We will not have the attention of the user always.

#### Stress affects attention

Stress: External and mental stimuli affecting our level of arousal, noise, light, vibration, anger, fear, etc..

The graph shows that stress improves our performance to a certain point. But after that point the performance drops a lot. The more skilled you are at the task, the more stress you can handle. So if we design an app to be used in noisy/stressful environment we should expect the user to be somewhat stressed.

 #### Mental workload

- Level of user "busyness" and task difficulty
- NASA task load index

The above table can be used to evaluate a user interface. Can be used on a task.

#### Visual search

- To locate an item in a visual scene
- Search patterns cannot be predicted
- Visual attention is drawn towards interface items that are: Large, Bright, Changing.

#### Alerts and Error Messages

If an error occours (or there is a simple change in system state):

- Get the users attention (unobtrusive vs. obtrusive)
- Do not distract from main task.
- Do not overwhelm with information.

**More detailed guidelines for error messages:**

- Careful wording (direct, but not rude)
- Avoid threatening words (catasphrophe etc..)
- Do not use double negation
- Be specific (e.g. "enter your name")
- No uppercase letters (We loose the form of the words, and slows down the reading speed. And it looks like we are yelling)
- Use attention-grabbing techniques with caution
