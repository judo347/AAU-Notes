## Problem Domain Analysis

#### Class Diagram

#### Generalization Structure

![](.\img\2.png)

Is a taxi a passenger car? Is a private car a passenger car?

Generalization class. Specialization class. Abstract class (marked with italics, as seen on the above picture to the right).

#### Cluster

![](.\img\3.png)

#### Aggregation

![](.\img\4.png)

The numbers show how many are involved. So for instance between wheel and car, it is 1 car per 4 wheels.

Car ownership relation: a person can have 0 to infinite cars.

#### Evaluate Systematically

Structures must be used correctly

- Generalization versus aggregation (is-a/has-a).
- Aggregation versus association (page 87).

Structures must be conceptually true

- Names, concepts, and structure reflect the user's understanding.
- The prospective user.

Structures must be simple

- Especially at the top levels.
- Avoid objects changing class. (customer turning into employee)
- Check against the system definition.

#### Generally

- Selecting the right structure is difficult
  - Try them out one by one for each pair of classes
  - Use the criteria to select the most correct structure
- It is very easy to include too many structures
  - Try to simulate functions and see if you can get to the relevant objects

#### Structure

- Class structures
  - Generalization
  - Cluster
- Object structures
  - Aggregation
  - Association



Association = ----------------------

Aggregation = ------<>

Generalization = ---------->

#### Discuss the Diagram

Customer and Appointment is an aggregation: they cannot stand without the other. Free is confusing.  Apprentice can turn into assistant: not allowed.

## Explore Patterns

#### Role

- A person can have different roles
- The roles for a person change dynamically over time

#### Relation

- Objects from two classes are related

![](.\img\8.png)

#### Hierarchy

- Objects from different classes form a hierarchy

![](.\img\9.png)

#### Item-Descriptor

- Properties of objects from one class (items) are described in an object from another class (descriptor). As in a library: book - is that the physical book or the one that is registered in the IT system.
