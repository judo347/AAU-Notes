# Architectural Design

#### Results

Architectural design has two views:

#### Component Architeture

Static .

Classes, stable aspects, related components, logical level and structure for descriptions.

#### Process Arcitectiure

Dynamic: what is going on over time.

Objects, dynamic aspects, coordination of processes, physical level and structure for execution.

#### Principles

- Define and prioritize criteria. (Focus on usability or something else)
- Bridge criteria and technical platform.
- Evaluate design early.

#### Criteria:

- General criteria. (**Usable**, secure, efficient, correct, reliable, maintainable, testable, **flexible**, **comprehensible**, reusable, portable and interoperable) (Which us these will we focus on?) (Correct = consistent based on the requirements. Fulfils the requirements)
- Specific criteria in OOA&D:
  - Usability
    - The systems as a whole
    - The users' needs
    - The technical platform
  - Flexibility
    - Consequences of changes
    - Modular design
  - Comprehensibility
    - Overview
    - Abstraction
    - Use of patterns

You can mix the two: Open architecture + relaxed = spaghetti code.

NS = network system, DBS = Database system, UIS = user interface system.

U = user interface, F = functions, M = model.

It is possible to have a distributed data and for the server to also have functions. But then one would have a subset of functions.
