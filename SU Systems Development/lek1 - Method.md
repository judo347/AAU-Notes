System = Collection of components that implement modeling requirements, functions and interface.

| Interface (UI) | Connection to users or equipment. Text, graphics, printouts, etc. Rader and sensors |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Functions**  | Contains the facilities through the interface(users/equipment) updates the model |
| **Model**      | Contains dynamic model of the system's problem domain        |

- Model the context: Model both app. and problem domain during A&D. 

- Emphasize the architecture: Aim for easy-to-understand architecture.
- Reuse patterns: use common patterns for quality and productivity.
- Tailor the method to suit specific projects: OOA&D has to be shaped to fit the project.
