## PACT

People Activities Context and Technologies.

Example: Volkswagen SUV and Racecar(2 seats). Family, race driver and bankman.

Solution: Family is properly going for the SUV, race driver for the racecar and bankman for both. (Depending on the purpose of their activity)

### People

People is central. But people might have:

**Physiological differences:**

- Disabilities (blindness, motor control etc.)
- Finger size (male/female, thick/thin)
- Fitts' Law (measuring motor control): $T_{(time to move)}=k*log_2(D / S + 0.5)$

Above equation is calculating the time it takes a user to move the mouse on a computer screen from point a to point be. *k* is a constant, *D* is distant the curser has to move and *S* size of the object you are trying to access.

**Psychological differences:** 

- Spatial abilities
- Attention
- Memory
- Emotional disorders (depression)
- Personality types

The above image is about the user seeing concepts in the system like a button. For example the button might look like its for one think, when it does something completely different.

**Social differences: **

- Motivation
- Novice/Expert
- Homogeneous groups
- Heterogeneous groups

Example: a airplane cockpit: it is designed for exports and homogenous. Moodle: homogeneous user group, has both novice and expert users.





### Activities in contexts

What is the purpose (of users doing this activity that it should support). The below listed is questions to ask when starting out designing.

Temporal aspects (10):

- Frequency of activity
- Time pressure and peaks
- Continuous or interrupted?
- System response time
- Collaboration: working alone or with others?
- Complexity: well-defined or vague tasks?
- Safety-critical: risk of injuries?
- Safety-critical: what happens when mistakes are made?
- Nature of the content: Amount of data entries?
- Nature of the content: media types?

#### Contexts

Physical, social and organizational. Is the product designed to be used in a warehouse were people wear gloves? Buttons then need to be gloves-friendly.



### Technologies

#### input technologies

Example: old iPhone: touch, tactile(buttons), auditory, compass, accelerometer, GPS and biometric.

#### output techonologies

Audible, visual, and more!

Screen, projector, GPS-device, etc..

### EXAMPLE of PACT

Lamborghini vs Volkswagen SUV.

**P**: Primary users are female and male adults with a drivers license. They typically have a family and need extra space for children and luggage. They have a mid to high income.

**A**: Daily activities include driving children to daycare and picking them up as well as driving to work. Spare time activities include field trips in semi rough nature, trips to the beach and fishing. Activities are safety critical! (They are always critical when driving in a car)

**C**: Outdoors only, sometimes in semi rough terrain. Socially, there may be up to five persons (typically family members).

**T**: Simple input in terms of steering, moving, forward/backwards and changing gears. Safety technology include airbags, ESP and ABS. Engine technology must ensure an effective fuel consumption.

So then it become clear that the user is most fitted for the SUV.
