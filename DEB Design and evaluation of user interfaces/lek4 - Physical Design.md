# Physical Design

How the system is going to look in the end.

**Conceptual design**: Determining: Logic, Functions, Structure, Content.

**Physical design**: Physical realization of: Logic, Functions, Structure, Content.

The UI: "Everything in the system that people come in contact with."

- **Physically**, people interact by:
  - Pressing buttons, touching a screen, moving a mouse over a table, etc..
- **Perceptually**, people interact through:
  - What they can see, hear and feel.
- **Conceptually**, people need to:
  - Know what commands exits
  - Know that certain data is available
  - Know how to navigate
  - Be able to find details
  - Be able to gain an overview

Two often used types of GUI: commando prompt and windows explorer. You can do the same, but do it in different ways. Representation vs. commandos and syntax.

#### WIMP

- Windows
- Icons
  - Understandable, familiar, unambiguous, memorable, informative, few, distinct, attractive, legible, compact, coherent and extensible.
- Menus
  - Cascading (unfolds when you mouse over or click an element), pop-up, contextual.
- Pointers

## Widget guidelines

Radio buttons: the form is a circle and you can only pick one option.

Checkboxes: square and you can pick multiple.

Different widgets that we are familiar with: Toolbars, textbox, drop downs, date, textarea, password, tel, URL, etc..

#### Nielsens heuristics (revised)

1. Visibility of system status (Like i Word where you can see that caret blinking and shows where you are placed in the document + the toolbar shows what options are active.)
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
