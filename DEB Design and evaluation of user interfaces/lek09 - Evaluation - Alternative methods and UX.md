# Lek 9 - Evaluation - Alternative methods and UX

### User Experience

#### What is UX

- modern term.
- A person's *perceptions* and *responses* that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system or service..
- Dimensionality explosion: so many levels that we can explore when talking about UX

- We have UX and not only usability because in game: the goal for usability is getting from a to b with the least amount of resistance. If this was for a game, it would not be a great game. So therefore is the job called UX and not Usability.

#### How is UX data collected?

- Quenstionaires - 53%
- Interviews (semi-structured) - 20%
- Videorecordings - 17%
- User observation (live) - 17%
- ..
- ...
- Other methods - 27%

AttrakDiff uses *sementic differentials* to access the user experience of a product according to 4 catagories:

- **Pragmatic Quality**: Clarity of interaction model, usability.
- **Attractivity**: General aesthetic quality.
- **Hedonic Quality (Identity)**: Resonation between self-perception of user and product.
- **Hedonic Quality (Stimulation)**: Potential for reaching individual goals as perceived by the user (missing in the example above).

#### Emotions

- A 2D coordinate system can be use: x = valence(goodness or badness), y = arousal.

- Galvanic skin response (GSR). The lie detected.
- Electromyography (EMG) = electrode in your face. Measures facial expressions.

#### Remote user tests

Can be done via a webcam and such. You can also you google analytics to she what the users are doing on your site ( does not show why they do it).

#### Usability problems are present in the system when the system is:

- **Unuseful**: You cannot find the document or functions you need to solve your tasks.
- **Difficult to learn**: It takes a long time to learn how to use the system.
- **Difficult to remember**: It takes a long time to find elements in the system, which you have used previously.
- **Ineffective to use**: It takes a long time to solve certain tasks with the system.
- **Unsatisfying to use**: The system does not feel comfortable to use, it is not joyful to work with it.
