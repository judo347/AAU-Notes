# Envisionment

Is about making ideas visible. Externalization: Representing design products to ourselves and others (who?) Generation, communication and evaluation of ideas.

##### Types of representation

Two critical skills for the designer:

- Choosing suitable representations.
- Making good use of chosen representations

Choosing representations:

- Exploration (e.g. sketches and wireframes)
- Accuracy (e.g. prototypes)

Using representations:

- Accurate enough, but not confusing (main features must stand out)

#### Basic techniques (exploring by nature)

- Sketching (sketching of how the elements of the program will be placed. Make sure requirements make it into the UI and sketching)
- Storyboards (showing a flow between windows. Depicturing actions. See below)
- Wireframes (like a sketch but much more close to how a program would like)
- Navigation maps (see picture below)

#### Prototypes (Sketch is non-interactive and a prototype is interactive)

- Lo-fi prototypes
  - Paper prototypes
  - Quick to produce (throw-away)
  - Broad emphasis on: Content, Structure, Key functions and Navigation
- Hi-fi prototypes
  - Plug in the power cord!
  - High level of detail (layout and graphics)
  - Useful for detailed evaluation of specific design elements and features
- Trade-offs
  - Lo-fi
    - Cheap, lack of detail, not realistic, low level of validity when testing.
  - Hi-fi
    - Expensive, Realistic, High level of validity when testing, Testing is done at a later stage, Premature commitment, Clients believe they are real, Reluctance in making radical changes.
