I pick Moodle. 

**What is the aim for the system**: to provide a place for teachers to put information and users to get  information about lectures and semesters (a lot of information related to your study).

**Who are the target users**:  students, teachers and administration personal.

**What activities is the system supposed to support, and in which context(s)**: 

- provide schedules for students.
- provide a place for teachers to display information and students to get that information. (a connection between students and teachers about lectures)

**Why did the use of the system lead to a poor experience**: 

- User interface is confusing and displays too much information at ones.
- There is not always a direct path to want you want. 
- It has a tough learning curve.

**How would you improve this**:

- Display less information at once.
- A better way to get you started with finding your courses and semester.
- Remove unused or excess elements.
