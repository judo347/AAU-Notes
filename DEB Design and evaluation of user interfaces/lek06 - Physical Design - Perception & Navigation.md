# Perception and Navigation

## Perception

Perception is about how we come to know an environment and sensing an environment.

**Detecting**: Color, Shapes, Edges. **Theories of visual perceptions**: Depth perception, Pattern recognition.

#### Perceptual set

Our previous experiences that makes us interpret particular depth and patterns in a particular way.

**Perceptual set**: Expectations, Past experience, Affect, Motivation, Individual differences, Cultural factors.

#### Depth perception

Important when designing 3D apps like games. We understand depth: primary cues and secondary cues.

Primary cues:

- Retinal disparity (two sperate images)
- Stereopsis (image combining process)
- Accommodation (muscular process to create image focus)
- Convergence (muscular process for image focus on short distances)

Secondary cues (2D plane, monocular):

- Light and shade

- Linear perspective

- Height in horizontal plane
- Motion parallax
- Overlap
- Relative size
- Texture gradient

#### Pattern Recognition

**Gestalt laws** of perception:

- Proximity (Elements positioned together belong together)
- Continuity (Connectedness between elements)
- Similarity (Object shapes that are the same)
- Closure (images that are not complete, but nevertheless complete an image. One image in pieces.)
- There are more Gestalt laws.

#### Affordance

Gibson:

"*The affordance of the environment are what it offers animals, what it provides or furnishes, for good or ill*."

So, an affordance is a resource that the environment offers an animal and.. .. the animal must possess the capabilities to perceive and use the resource.

Norman:

"*It is perceived affordance that tell the users what actions can be performed on an object and, to some extent, how to do them*."

If you look at a button, you should be able to know what it does when you click it: is it formed as a button, does the text describe the action?

## Navigation

#### Navigation activities

Object identification: 

- Identifying categories and clusters of objects.

Wayfinding: 

- Working out how to reach a destination.

Exploration: 

- Understanding what exists in an environment.

- How objects are related.

Three types of signs:

- Informational signs (object identification)
- Directional signs (wayfinding)
- Warning and reassurance signs (exploration)

#### Informational signs (Object Identification)

Signs for information on object: Navigational elements look different, conventional menu positioning (top of page).

Orienting oneself: Heading and navigational elements clearly separated from main content.

Classification of objects. TV logo, Audio icon, Separation by color themed boxes (White boxes = Text articles, Black boxes = TV broadcasts, Grey boxes = radio broadcasts).

##### Directional sign (Wayfinding)

Apple guidelines:

- Provide one path for one destination
- Make the path logical

Information on route and route hierarchy: visible layed division of menu elements.

General/local directions: top menu with high level directions, local directions at each high-level object-

One path for one destination: Check! Yet, you may also use the search bar..

Path logic: Logical, i.e. sport results under News/Sport/Results.

#### Warning and reassurance signs (Exploration)

Apple guideline:

- Provide markers of where you are
- Traceability

Recognizing the destination is reached: headings, overview of key content at the top.

Markers of current location/route monitoring: bread crumbs/menu markings.

Traceability: back/forward buttons (trivial on an information page such as dr.dk, non-trivial in web applications)
