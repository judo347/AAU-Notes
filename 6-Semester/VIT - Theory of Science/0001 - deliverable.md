# Deliverable 1

### Write one paragraph summary of the area where you do your current project.

The current project is based on making a robot that plays football in the robotics competition RoboCup. The computer science areas used in the project will most likely be **machine intelligence**, **simulation** and **data analysis**. Machine intelligence will be used to control and organise the robots. Simulation will most likely be utilised for finding the best strategy/action for each player. And data analysis is for interpret and process the noisy information each robot player receives. 

### Find two suitable workshops and two suitable conferences where your current project work could be possibly published. The submission deadline for the conferences/workshops should be in this or next year. For each workshop/conference provide its full name, acronym, an URL to the home-page of the event and the submission deadline.
