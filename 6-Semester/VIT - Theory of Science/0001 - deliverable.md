### Write one paragraph summary of the area where you do your current project.

The current project is based on making a robot that plays football in the robotics competition RoboCup. The computer science areas used in the project will most likely be **machine intelligence**, **simulation** and **data analysis**. Machine intelligence will be used to control and organise the robots. Simulation will most likely be utilised for finding the best strategy/action for each player. And data analysis is for interpret and process the noisy information each robot player receives. 

### Find two suitable workshops and two suitable conferences where your current project work could be possibly published. The submission deadline for the conferences/workshops should be in this or next year. For each workshop/conference provide its full name, acronym, an URL to the home-page of the event and the submission deadline.

The workshops and conferences has deadline early 2020, and the groups work is not done before later this year. I expect the below mentioned will be held again next year, so if I want to participate, it will be 2021, and the same events.

**Workshops:**

- The ECAI 2020 Workshop on Robustness of AI Systems Against Adversarial Attacks
  - RAISA3

Names of all students participating in the preparation: Alihan Øztürk, Jon T. Nilsson, Christopher P. Krejler, and Mathias Hindsgaul.

Feedback received in lecture:

- Title: good
- Abstract
  - First sentence great
  - Too much introduction
  - Only 1-2 lines introduction
  - Use we after first paragraph
  - Second paragraph: what we made
  - Last sentence should start: "We constructed"

Title: **Simulation Framework for Automated Storage- and Retrieval Systems**

Abstract:

*The logistic demands of automated warehouses increase, as online shopping is expected to increase in the coming years. We constructed a framework which supports the implementation and testing of Multi Agent Path-Finding algorithms, using centralized communication, which aids in improving automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). The framework, with minor tweaks allows for comparison between centralized and de-centralized ASRS including simulation and evaluation of Path-Finding algorithms in both system architectures.*
