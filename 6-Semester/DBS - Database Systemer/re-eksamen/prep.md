**What is SQL**: ?????? TODO

a *declarative* query language ("What" not "how"). Used to 

Introduction: (Explain terms)

- Tables can contain duplicates
- Tables can have an order
- Tables must not necessarily have a key

SQL sublanguages: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-ddl-dml-tcl-dcl/

- DDL: Data Definition Language: basic definition of data: create, change and deletion of tables.
- DML: Data Manipulation Language: TODO: INSERT INTO
- DCL: Data Control Language: Rights management: used to CONTROL the ACCESS to a db: Create, Drop, Rename
- TCL: Transaction Control Language: MANAGE TRANSACTIONS in db: Rollback, Commit, Savepoint
- DQL: Data Query Language: PERFORMS QUERIES on DATA within SCHEMA OBJECTS: Grant, Revoke (Advanced SQL)

Example: (TODO, bug tid p√• eksemplet! Uddyb)

```sql
SELECT name, year, producer.vineyard
FROM wine, producer
WHERE wine.vineyard = producer.vineyard
```

#### Nested Queries

```sql
SELECT name
FROM professor
WHERE empid IN (SELECT taughtby FROM course);
```
