**Rewrite the BNF of Example 3.4 to give + precedence over * and force + to be right associative.**

we switch + with *.

**Using the grammar in Example 3.2, show a parse tree and a leftmost derivation for each of the following statements:**
	**a. A = A * (B + (C * A))**

**Prove that the following grammar is ambiguous:**
**<S> → <A>**
**<A> → <A> + <A> | <id>**
**<id> → a | b | c**
