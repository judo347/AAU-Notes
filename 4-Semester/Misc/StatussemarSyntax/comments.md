## 2.3 Solution Criteria

*The first criteria reflects on the ease of use as well as how easy it is to understand, specifically in relation to home automation. This is important, since being able to easily write and understand the code, will allow
developers to be more productive.* P5 at the buttom.

**How will you prove that the code your language will produce is easy to write and read? Will you compare in to similar purpose code?** 

## 4.1 Language Design

*Pivot has two new types. The Signal type and the Device type.*

**Two new types compared to what?** Something from chapter 3?

## 4.3 Abstract syntax

**Der er en del der er på Dansk: Syntaktiske Kategorier...**

**I think that the overall abstract syntax is too specific, and includes notations that is from the BNF: (..)***

*$i \in inst$* - **What does inst mean?**

*$b \in block$* - **That "b" should have been a capital one.**

*$a ::= n | x$* - **x is not mentioned anywhere else? What is it?**

*$e ::= ´when´\; b \; block$* - **Should "block" not be "B"?**

**Input is mentioned in the construction rules for d, but "output" is never mentioned?**
