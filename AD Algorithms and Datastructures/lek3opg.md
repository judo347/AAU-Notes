#### lecture 3

1. **Run the merge sort algorithm on the following array of numbers: (3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 49, 9). Give the state of the array after five calls of the algorithm *Merge* are performed during the execution of *Merge-Sort*.**

   The first half will be sorted and the second half will have the pairs sorted.

   $(3, 26, 41, 52, 38, 57, 9, 49)$

2. **Consider an array *A*[*l*..*r*] of integers, where *r* - *l* + 1 = 2*k*, for some *k* > 0. Write a divide-and-conquer algorithm to find the two smallest numbers in this array. 
   Write a recurrence describing how many comparison operations your algorithm performs. Solve it to find the exact answer.
   What is the asymptotic worst-case running time of your algorithm? 
   How does it compare to the worst-case running time of the algorithm for the same problem from the first lecture's exercises?**
