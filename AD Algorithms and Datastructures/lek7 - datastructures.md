# Data structures

#### Abstract Data Types (ADT's)

- An ADT is a specification of
  - a set of data;
  - a set of operations that ca be performed on the data.
    - This operation set is the focus
- ADT is abstract in the sense that it is independent of various concrete implementations.
  - Encapsulates data structures and relevant algorithms.
  - Provides access interface.

#### Data abstractions

- ADT: An entity + opeations that can be performed on it
  - E.g., integer.
  - addition, subtraction, negation, multiplication, division, comparison.
- Advantages
  - Users only need to know what the allowed operations are, not how they are implemented.
  - You can choose the best possible implementation for an ADT when you need to use it.
    - Allows to separate the concerns of correctness and the performance analysis of your algorithms.
- We will learn ADTs of fundamental data structures
  - Arrays, stracks, queues, etc.
  - Focus on operations.

EN DEL AF DE SLIDES ER MÅSKE IKKE NØDVENDT: FOR BASIS.

SLIDES!!!!!!!!!!!!! 8, 10-16, 18-22, 25-33

SLIDE 31: line 2-4 skal være i den rækkefølge og line 1 skal være før line 4.
