**Run the heapsort algorithm on the following array of numbers:  (5, 13, 2, 25, 7, 17, 20, 8, 4). Give the state of the array (a) after the *BuildMaxHeap* operation, and (b) after three iterations of the loop.**

a:

![](.\img\178.png)

A = 25, 13, 20, 8, 7, 17, 2, 5, 4

The array is now a heap

b:

So 3rd iteration: (2,13,5,8,7,4,17,20,25)
